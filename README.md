# WordCrusher
A trivia mobile game created in the game engine Corona Lab. The idea is simple, a question will appear after three seconds of each round. Random answers will fly across the screen and only one of them will be the correct one. If you do pick the correct answer, you will go to next level and the velocity of the answers will increase. If you are not able pick the answer in time before it leaves the screen, you will automatically lose. If you choose the wrong answer three times, you will also lose. We keep your highscore for the session in the top right corner of the screen. The objective is to always beat it. Can you do it?

## Getting Started

You must either download corona labs and add the project by pressing on the main.lua file in our directory or you take the apk that we have and insert it on your phone so you can play.

## Extra Comments
The questions and answers were all created by me, Jessie Cisneros, and Joey Gao.
